- 👋 Hi, I’m Kyle Chan (@kylechanpols)
- 👀 In terms of methodology, I'm interested in Computational Methods, Statistical Learning and Bayesian Statistics.
- 🎓 I actively use these methods to conduct research on territorial politics, territorial reforms, political parties and voter behavior.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Stan and Python. Learning and using R everyday.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any substantive/ methodological research project on territorial reforms, political parties or elections in the European or East Asian context.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: kylechan@unc.edu
